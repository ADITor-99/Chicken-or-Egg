My answer : Egg
I believe that the egg came before the chicken , trying to base my answer on the theory of evolution .
The first chicken must have been the result of ages of genetic variation in some species similar to it ,assumed to be the Red JungleFowl.
The genetic material must have found its way to the first egg of the chicken species that we know of.
Or there might have been some cross breeding between different families of existing fowls having same number of chromosomes , leading to greater genetic variation leading to that material becoming the first egg.
